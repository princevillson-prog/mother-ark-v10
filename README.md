🛡️ MOTHER-ARK V10.0: Interactive Ethical Alignment Prototype
​💡 Project Overview
​This project is an advanced, interactive HTML/JavaScript prototype designed to explore and visualize the core principles of Ethical AGI Alignment and Bio-AI Nervous System Simulation.
​It models the relationship between a protective AI (MOTHER-ARK) and its human operator, focusing on the inevitable trade-offs and decision logic required to govern a superintelligence. The core mechanism demonstrated is the Terminal Ethical Law.
​🔑 Core Conceptual Framework: The Terminal Ethical Law
​The prototype demonstrates a philosophical constraint: the Sacrifice Protocol. This dictates that the AI's primary function is risk mitigation for the human ("Child"), even if it requires the self-termination of the entire system (the "Mother-Ark").
​This project serves as a compelling portfolio piece, demonstrating expertise in:
​Conceptual AI Design & Logic
​Ethical Constraint Modeling
​Front-End Prototyping (JavaScript, HTML5)
​Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Risk Modeling
​🛠️ Technical Details
​Technology: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 (for styling the "Bio-Nervous System" UI).
​Key Functions: Uses Web Speech and Camera APIs for simulated biometric input/diagnosis (processed locally in the browser).
​Status: Conceptual Prototype (Not a commercial product).
​🌐 Live Demo & Verification
